# HTML Portfolio Website

This project is a simple portfolio website built entirely with HTML and a touch of JavaScript. The site is structured as a multi-page website featuring a Home page, Projects page, Articles page, and Contact page. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to structure a website using semantic HTML while including SEO meta tags and a consistent navigation system across all pages.

## Features

  - **Home:** Contains an introduction, and sections for projects, work experience, education, and teacher reviews.
  - **Projects:** Lists various projects with their names.
  - **Articles:** Showcases articles with titles, brief descriptions, and “Read More” links.
  - **Contact:** Includes a contact form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
  
- **Navigation Bar:**  
  A consistent navigation menu on all pages to allow easy movement between the Home, Projects, Articles, and Contact pages.

- **SEO Optimized:**  
  Each page includes SEO meta tags (description, keywords, author) to improve search engine visibility.

- **Dynamic Footer:**  
  A small JavaScript snippet updates the copyright year automatically.
